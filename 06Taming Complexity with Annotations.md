#Taming Complexity with Annotations

In the previous chapter, you learned how to create a RESTful API that involved
receiving a request from the Internet, routing it to the controllers, and processing
it. In this chapter, you will learn how to use annotations in the DocBlock, a way
of performing routing that requires even less code and can be a faster and more
organized way of doing collaborative programming with a team.
Annotations will be demonstrated for:

* Routing of HTTP requests such as GET, POST, and PUT
* Turning a controller into a fully enabled CRUDL resource
* Listening to events that are fired from commands
* Adding middleware to controllers to limit or filter requests
