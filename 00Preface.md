While CodeIgniter was one of the first frameworks to enjoy widespread popularity,
this popularity would come to be its undoing years later, as its large spread use
and low barrier to entry meant it couldn't take advantage of newer versions of
PHP without losing backwards compatibility, and potentially breaking lots of
applications.

This saw it then be surpassed by faster-moving alternatives such as
Symfony and even FuelPHP, which was developed as a response to CodeIgniter's
unwillingness to embrace change.

Enter: Laravel. Laravel joined the framework scene when there were already many
players. However, the developers of Laravel used this timing to their advantage,
instead creating a framework that avoided all of the problems and mistakes previous
full stack frameworks had made and building on top of the excellent Symfony
components in order to create a robust, component-based framework.
Instead of providing dozens of inflexible libraries, Laravel provides sensible,
driver-based components that developers could use to build applications their
own way, rather than trying to mash everything into the layout the framework
author defined. This led to Laravel rising in popularity. It was also a fast-moving
framework, and, by version 4, had become the most starred framework on GitHub,
a testament to its popularity
