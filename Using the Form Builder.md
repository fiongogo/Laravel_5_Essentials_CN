#Using the Form Builder

In this chapter, you will learn how to use Laravel's form builder. The form builder will be demonstrated to facilitate the building of the following elements:

* Form (open and close)
* Label
* Input (text, HTML5 password, HTML5 e-mail, and so on.)
* Checkbox
* Submit
* Anchor tags (href links)

Finally, we'll see an example of how to use the form builder to create the month,
date, and year selection elements for the accommodations reservation software form,
and how to create a macro to reduce the code duplication.
